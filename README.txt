This is going to be an e-commerce site that sells custom made leather goods.  
Right now a database is created to make a keychain. You will need to load .Net Entity Framework, 
Bootstrap, and Jquery for it to run. 
It has a SQL database through localdb. 
It has a KeyChain model with an Id, Color, EndType, and an empty string value called Engraved
where a custom message can be written.
There is also a Keychains Controller that controls the back end page of the website. 
You can access the back end page by clicking on the admin link at the bottom of the home page. 
On the Admin page you will see the Seed data I left in for the project. 
You can create a new key chain directly from the admin page.
The Admin page will read it from the database.
You can click on a keychain and update the information. 
You can also click the delete link to delete a keychain within the database instance. 
You can also look at the details of an individual keychain.
